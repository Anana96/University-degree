00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:29.231
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.279
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...</i>

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:42.697
<i>...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.538
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.244
<i>...are easily corrupted.</i>

00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:53.127
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:05.641
<i>It betrayed Isildur to his death.</i>

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:11.687
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...</i>

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:14.235
<i>...were lost.</i>

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.275
<i>History became legend...</i>

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.484
<i>...legend became myth.</i>

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:22.574
<i>And for 2500 years...</i>

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.449
<i>...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.</i>

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.917
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.710
<i>...it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:39.925
GOLLUM:
My precious.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.713
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>The Ring came to the creature Gollum...</i>

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:46.804
<i>...who took it deep
into the Misty Mountains.</i>

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:49.977
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.223
GOLLUM:
It came to me.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:56.855
My own. My love. My own.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:01.775
My precious.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:08.827
FEMALE VOICE: <i>The Ring
brought to Gollum unnatural long life.</i>

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.875
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:17.671
<i>And in the gloom of Gollurn's cave,
it waited.</i>

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:21.127
<i>Darkness crept back into
the forests of the world.</i>

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.221
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.216
<i>...whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:30.729
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.732
<i>...its time had now come.</i>

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.816
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:43.992
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:49.411
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

00:06:49.618 --> 00:06:50.658
BILBO:
What's this?

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.329
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.245
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.207
A ring.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.297
GOLLUM:
Lost!

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:05.507
My precious is lost!

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.007
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>For the time will soon come...</i>

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:13.431
<i>...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.</i>

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:39.464
MALE VOICE:
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.086
[WAGON RUMBLES]

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:48.097
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:53.224
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:56.891
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

00:07:57.102 --> 00:08:02.062
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>
