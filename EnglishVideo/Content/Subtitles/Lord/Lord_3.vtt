<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

00:07:57.102 --> 00:08:02.062
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:06.482
<i>-And I must follow if I can
</i>-You're late.

00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:13.581
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:18.999
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:33.433
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:41.018
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.317
FRODO: What news of the world?
Tell me everything.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:49.317
Everything? You're far too eager
and curious for a Hobbit.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:50.949
Most unnatural.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.950
What can I tell you?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:59.538
Life in the wide world goes on
much as it has this past Age.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:02.378
Full of its own comings and goings.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:05.464
Scarcely aware of the existence
of Hobbits.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.711
For which I am very thankful.

FEMALE HOBBIT:
It's Gandalf!

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:30.909
Oh, the long-expected party.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.703
How is the old rascal?

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:42.332
I hear it'll be a party
of special magnificence.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.499
You know Bilbo.
He's got the place in an uproar.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.418
That should please him.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:50.009
-Half the Shire's invited.
-Gracious me.

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:54.343
He's up to something.
All right, then. Keep your secrets.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.851
Before you came along,
Bagginses were well thought of.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.264
Never had any adventures.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:06.730
If you're referring to the dragon
incident, I was barely involved.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.530
All I did was give your uncle
a nudge out of the door.

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:14.823
Well, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

00:10:15.198 --> 00:10:17.078
Oh, really?

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:24.587

FEMALE HOBBIT 2: Gandalf!
MALE HOBBIT: Fireworks, Gandalf!

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.404
Gandalf?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:02.081
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.005
So am I.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.395
Whoa, whoa.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.284
BILBO:
No, thank you!

00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:45.411
We don't want any visitors,
well-wishers or relations!

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:49.122
And what about very old friends?

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.005
Gandalf?

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:58.131
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:03.473
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?
