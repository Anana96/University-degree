00:00:01.726 --> 00:00:04.024
I had a dream about you
last night.

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:04.889
About me?

00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.123
Yes, is that entirely proper
for you...

00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:09.325
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.391
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.495
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:18.235
At least once more,
Miss Swann, as always.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:19.435
There. See?

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.876
At least the boy has a sense
of propriety.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:25.541
We really must be going.
There you are.

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.607
Good day, Mr. Turner.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.942
Come along.

00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:34.349
Good day.

00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.419
Elizabeth.

00:02:07.818 --> 00:02:09.274
What... hey.

00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:12.208
Hold up, there, you.

00:02:12.323 --> 00:02:16.350
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat at the dock.

00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:20.221
And I shall need to know
your name.

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:24.498
What do you say
to three shillings,

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.490
and we forget the name?

00:02:29.673 --> 00:02:32.403
Welcome to Port Royal
Mr. Smith.

00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:10.503
Two paces march!

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:15.012
Right about-face!

00:03:17.388 --> 00:03:20.243
Present arms!

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:46.443
This dock is off limits
to civilians.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.314
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't know.

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:51.288
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:51.913
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:58.320
There's some sort of high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort.

00:03:58.395 --> 00:04:01.660
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen such as yourselves

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:04.495
did not merit an invitation?

00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:07.560
Someone has to make sure
this dock stays off limits.

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:09.435
It's a fine goal to be sure.

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:13.670
But it seems to me
that a ship like that

00:04:13.777 --> 00:04:17.076
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

00:04:17.147 --> 00:04:20.002
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true.

00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:23.440
But there's no ship as can match
the Interceptor for speed.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.612
I've heard of one.

00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:27.953
It's supposed to be very fast.
Nigh uncatchable.

00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:29.788
The Black Pearl.

00:04:30.928 --> 00:04:36.560
Well, there's no real ship
as can match the Interceptor.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:38.589
Black Pearl is a real ship.

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.466
No.
No, it's not.

00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:42.232
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.

00:04:42.373 --> 00:04:43.738
You've seen it?

00:04:43.874 --> 00:04:44.670
Yes.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.698
You haven't seen it.

00:04:46.777 --> 00:04:47.971
Yes, I have.

00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:51.276
You've seen a ship
with black sails

00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:55.739
that's crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.152
that Hell itself
spat him back out?

00:04:59.323 --> 00:05:00.415
No.

00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:02.026
No.

00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:04.358
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:05.325
Oh.

00:05:05.496 --> 00:05:07.555
No ship that's not crewed
by the damned

00:05:07.664 --> 00:05:10.497
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell spat him out

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:13.627
could possibly have black sails,
therefore couldn't be

00:05:13.704 --> 00:05:15.001
any other ship
than the Black Pearl.

00:05:15.072 --> 00:05:17.836
Is that what you're saying?

00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:19.033
No.

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:21.964
Like I said,
there's no real ship

00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:24.535
as can match the Interceptor.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.111
Hey!

00:05:28.218 --> 00:05:29.583
You!

00:05:30.687 --> 00:05:31.779
Get away from there!

00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:34.221
You don't have permission
to be there.

00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:36.555
I'm sorry.
It's such a pretty boat.

00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:37.719
Ship.

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:38.784
What's your name?

00:05:38.896 --> 00:05:41.421
Smith.
Or Smithy, if you like.

00:05:41.532 --> 00:05:44.865
What's your purpose
in Port Royal Mr. Smith?

00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:46.059
Yeah.
And no lies.

00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:49.526
Well, then, I confess.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.631
It is my intention to
commandeer one of these ships,

00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:53.607
pick up a crew in Tortuga,
raid, pillage, plunder,

00:05:53.777 --> 00:05:56.439
and otherwise pilfer
my weaselly black guts out.

00:05:56.513 --> 00:05:59.812
- I said no lies.
- I think he's telling the truth.

00:05:59.883 --> 00:06:03.546
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.011
Unless you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

00:06:17.868 --> 00:06:20.132
May I have a moment?

00:06:28.612 --> 00:06:30.705
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.641
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:43.682
This promotion throws
into sharp relief

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.491
that which I have not yet
achieved.

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.722
A marriage to a fine woman.

00:06:52.603 --> 00:06:55.697
You have become
a fine woman, Elizabeth.

00:06:55.806 --> 00:06:57.694
I can't breathe.

00:06:57.808 --> 00:07:01.665
Yes, I' m a bit nervous myself.

00:07:03.514 --> 00:07:05.778
And then they made me
their chief.

00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:09.880
Elizabeth?

00:07:11.955 --> 00:07:12.887
Elizabeth!

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.878
My God.

00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:15.686
The rocks!

00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:18.283
Sir, it's a miracle
she missed them.

00:07:20.397 --> 00:07:23.286
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim.

00:07:24.968 --> 00:07:27.198
Pride of the King's Navy,
you are.

00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:29.159
Do not lose these.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.379
What was that?
