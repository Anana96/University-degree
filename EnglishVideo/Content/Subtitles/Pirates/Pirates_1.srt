1
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:34,089
Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho

2
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:38,764
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

3
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,697
Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho

4
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:46,201
Yo ho, yo ho

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,704
A pirate's life for me

6
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:54,107
We extort, we pilfer,
we filch and sack

7
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,280
Drink up

8
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:56,618
Quiet, missy.

9
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,283
Cursed pirates sail
these waters.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,055
You don't want to bring them.

11
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,757
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

12
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,061
She was singing about pirates.

13
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:07,863
It's bad luck to be singing
about pirates

14
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,994
with us mired
in this unnatural fog.

15
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,231
Mark my words.

16
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:13,237
Consider them marked.

17
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,603
On your way.

18
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:16,768
Aye, Lieutenant.

19
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,438
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board, too.

20
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:22,244
Even a miniature one.

21
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:25,547
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

22
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,645
Think again, Miss Swann.

23
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:31,453
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

24
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:34,586
I intend that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

25
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:38,519
or wears a pirate brand gets
what he deserves.

26
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,523
A short drop and a sudden stop.

27
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,898
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

28
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,670
but I' m concerned
about the effect

29
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,108
this subject will have
upon my daughter.

30
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,045
My apologies, Governor Swann.

31
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,140
Actually,
I find it all fascinating.

32
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,845
Yes.
That's what concerns me.

33
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,779
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

34
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,207
LT. NORRINGTON:
Man overboard!

35
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,753
Man the ropes.
Fetch a hook.

36
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,655
Haul him aboard.

37
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,896
He's still breathing.

38
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,598
Mary, Mother of God.

39
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,474
GO V. SWANN:
What happened here?

40
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:01,947
It's the powder magazine.

41
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,405
Merchant vessels run
heavily armed.

42
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,743
Alot of good it did them.

43
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:11,485
Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just saying it.

44
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,150
Pirates.

45
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:17,686
There's no proof of that.
It's probably an accident.

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,663
LT. NORRINGTON:
Rouse the captain immediately.

47
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,795
Heave to and take in sail
Launch the boats.

48
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,901
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

49
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,036
He'll be in your charge.

50
00:03:32,113 --> 00:03:33,740
Take care of him.

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,125
It's okay.

52
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,966
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

53
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,564
Will Turner.

54
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,563
I'm watching over you, Will.

55
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,383
You're a pirate.

56
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,346
Has he said anything?

57
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,590
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

58
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:25,791
Take him below.

59
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,999
Elizabeth?

60
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,467
Are you all right?

61
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,305
Are you decent?

62
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,674
Yes.

63
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,542
Yes.

64
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:49,674
Still abed at this hour?

65
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,241
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

66
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,149
I have a gift for you.

67
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,658
Oh, it's beautiful

68
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,059
Isn't it?

69
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,556
May I inquire
as to the occasion?

70
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,999
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

71
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:11,397
Go on.

72
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,267
Actually, I...

73
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,372
I hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

74
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,779
The ceremony?

75
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,647
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

76
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,547
I knew it.

77
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,918
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

78
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,719
A fine gentleman,
don't you think?

79
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,056
He fancies you, you know.

80
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:37,086
Elizabeth?
How's it coming?

81
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,587
It's difficult to say.

82
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:42,056
I'm told it's the latest fashion
in London.

83
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:46,027
Well, women in London
must've learnt not to breathe.

84
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,102
Milord, you have a visitor.

85
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:49,800
Milord, you have a visitor.

86
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,622
Mr. Turner.

87
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,287
Good to see you again.

88
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:11,956
Good day, sir.

89
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,832
I have your order.

90
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:20,765
Well.

91
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,105
The blade is folded steel

92
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:26,374
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

93
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,176
If I may.

94
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,452
Perfectly balanced.

95
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:31,941
Perfectly balanced.

96
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,216
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

97
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,747
Impressive.
Very impressive.

98
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,419
Now, now.

99
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:45,591
Commodore Norrington is going
to be very pleased with this.

100
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,863
Do pass my compliments on
to your master.

101
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,464
I shall.

102
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,328
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

103
00:07:57,645 --> 00:08:01,433
Elizabeth,
you look absolutely stunning.

104
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,142
Will.

105
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:05,742
It's so good to see you.
