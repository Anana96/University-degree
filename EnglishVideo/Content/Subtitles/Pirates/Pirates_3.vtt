WEBVTT

00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:07.453
What was that?

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.521
Make way!

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:50.900
I got her!

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.130
She's not breathing!

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:54.766
Move!

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:02.772
I never would 've thought
of that.

00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:05.215
Clearly you've never been
to Singapore.

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:12.916
Where did you get that?

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:15.823
CDRE. NORRINGTON:
On your feet.

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:19.227
GO V. SWANN:
Elizabeth!

00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:21.525
Are you all right?

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:22.968
Yes, I' m fine.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:28.371
Shoot him.

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:29.375
- Father.
- What?

00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:32.936
Commodore, do you really
intend to kill my rescuer?

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:41.953
I believe thanks are in order.

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:50.191
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we, pirate?

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.698
Hang him.

00:01:52.768 --> 00:01:56.966
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.165
Well, well.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.629
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:03.598
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:06.601
Well, I don't see
your ship, Captain.

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.047
I'm in the market, as it were.

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:11.006
He said he'd come
to commandeer one.

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:14.713
Told you he was telling
the truth. These are his, sir.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.556
No additional shot nor powder.

00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.956
A compass
that doesn't point North.

00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:32.527
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

00:02:34.443 --> 00:02:38.300
You are without doubt the worst
pirate I' ve ever heard of.

00:02:38.414 --> 00:02:40.473
But you have heard of me.

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.287
Commodore,
I really must protest.

00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:46.914
Carefully, Lieutenant.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.253
Pirate or not,
this man saved my life.

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:51.349
One good deed is not enough
to redeem a man

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:52.826
of a lifetime of wickedness.

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:55.123
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.528
Indeed.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.964
Finally.

00:02:59.468 --> 00:03:00.492
No.

00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:01.534
No! Don't shoot!

00:03:01.603 --> 00:03:03.594
I knew you'd warm up to me.

00:03:03.672 --> 00:03:05.970
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

00:03:06.108 --> 00:03:07.473
And my hat.

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:09.741
Commodore.

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:15.477
- It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It 's Miss Swann.

00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:17.781
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:20.651
Come, come, dear.
We don't have all day.

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:24.385
Now if you'll be very kind.

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:42.869
Easy on the goods, darling.

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:45.009
You're despicable.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.105
Sticks and stones, love.

00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:50.777
I saved your life.
You save mine. We're square.

00:03:50.853 --> 00:03:54.345
Gentlemen, milady,
you will always remember this

00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:59.484
as the day that you almost
caught Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:04:16.078 --> 00:04:18.034
Whoa!

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:19.841
Now will you shoot him?

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:22.042
Open fire!

00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:24.211
Hey!

00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:30.751
On his heels!

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.130
MAN:
Take cover, man!

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.806
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

00:04:52.881 --> 00:04:55.441
I would hate for him to miss it.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.375
MAN:
Search upstairs!

00:05:01.523 --> 00:05:03.286
MAN #2:
Look lively, men!

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:46.289
Whoa!

00:06:35.884 --> 00:06:38.114
Right where I left you.

00:06:44.693 --> 00:06:47.184
Not where I left you.

00:06:56.905 --> 00:06:58.736
You're the one they're hunting.

00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:01.797
The pirate.

00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:04.869
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:08.712
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

00:07:08.784 --> 00:07:11.548
It would be a shame to
put a mark on your record.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.485
So if you'll excuse me.

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:19.558
Do you think this wise, boy?

00:07:19.628 --> 00:07:22.756
Crossing blades with a pirate?

00:07:22.831 --> 00:07:25.095
You threatened Miss Swann.

00:07:27.402 --> 00:07:30.098
Only a little.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.311
You know what you're doing. I' II
give you that. Excellent form.

00:07:46.388 --> 00:07:48.924
But how's your footwork?

00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:50.983
If I step here.

00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:53.025
Very good.

00:07:53.095 --> 00:07:55.120
And now I step again.

00:08:00.402 --> 00:08:01.232
Ta.
