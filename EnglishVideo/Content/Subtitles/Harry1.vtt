head of Slytherin house.

– What's he teach?
– Potions.

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:23.587
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

You're Nearly Headless Nick.

– That was bloody brilliant!
– Thank you for that assessment.

00:05:22.826 --> 00:05:27.121
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.542
– Then one of you might be on time.
– We got lost.

Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

00:05:58.361 --> 00:06:01.447
However, for those select few...

...who possess the predisposition...

00:06:09.372 --> 00:06:12.667
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:15.795
...and ensnare the senses.

00:06:16.004 --> 00:06:18.548
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:33.605
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

00:06:33.813 --> 00:06:39.777
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

00:08:47.196 --> 00:08:52.702
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

00:08:53.077 --> 00:08:56.414
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.
