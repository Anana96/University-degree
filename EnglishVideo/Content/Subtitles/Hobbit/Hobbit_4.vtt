00:00:00.164 --> 00:00:02.541
They seem to think you have tunnels
overflowing with gold.

00:00:02.542 --> 00:00:06.920
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.

00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:09.631
And it still smells of Troll.

00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:11.216
What on earth are you doing?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.139
Taking precautions. You know...

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.766
...I caught her making off
with the silverware once.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.729
- Who?
- Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.357
She had all my spoons
stuffed in her pocket. Ha!

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:28.734
Dreadful woman.

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:33.113
Make sure you keep an eye on her
after I'm...

00:00:33.114 --> 00:00:35.866
When I'm... When I'm...

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:40.867
When you're what?

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.789
It's nothing. Nothing.

00:00:49.756 --> 00:00:53.091
You know, some people are beginning
to wonder about you, Uncle.

00:00:53.092 --> 00:00:55.969
- Huh?
- They think you're becoming odd.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.639
Odd? Oh. Hm.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.140
Unsociable.

00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:03.226
Unsociable, me? Nonsense.

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:04.686
Be a good lad and put that...

00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:09.687
...on the gate.

00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:16.990
Do you think he'll come?

00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:18.325
Who?

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:19.576
Gandalf.

00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:23.789
Oh-ho. He wouldn't miss a chance
to let off his Whizpoppers. He'll give us...

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.457
...quite a show, you'll see.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:27.793
Right, then. I'm off.
- Off to where?

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:30.128
East-farthing Woods.
I'm going to surprise him.

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:35.129
Well, go on, then. You don't want to be late.

00:01:38.012 --> 00:01:42.683
<i>He doesn't approve of being late. Oh, no.
Not that I...</i>

00:01:42.684 --> 00:01:44.309
<i>. . . ever was.</i>

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.938
<i>In those days, I was always on time.</i>

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.025
<i>I was entirely respectable.</i>

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:56.238
<i>And nothing unexpected...</i>

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:01.239
<i>...ever happened.</i>

00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:24.933
- Good morning.
What do you mean?

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.854
Do you wish me a good morning
or do you mean that it is a good morning...

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:31.231
...whether I want it or not'?

00:02:31.232 --> 00:02:35.986
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good
on this particular morning?

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:40.987
Or are you simply stating
that this is a morning to be good on? Hm?

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:44.578
All of them at once, I suppose.

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.579
Hmm.

00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:51.418
Can I help you?

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.338
That remains to be seen.

00:02:55.339 --> 00:03:00.339
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.099
An adventure?

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.100
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree
would have much interest in adventures.

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:16.818
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.404
Make you late for dinner. Heh, heh.

00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:20.405
Mm.

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:22.491
Huh.

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:25.118
<i>Hmm.</i>

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.454
Oh. Ah.

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:28.789
Good morning.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.875
To think that I should have lived
to be "good morninged"...

00:03:31.876 --> 00:03:36.876
...by Belladonna Took's son
as if I were selling buttons at the door.

00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:39.174
Beg your pardon?

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:41.134
You've changed,
and not entirely for the better...

00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:42.511
...Bilbo Baggins.

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:43.929
I'm sorry, do I know you?

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.265
Well, you know my name,
although you don't remember I belong to it.

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:48.934
I'm Gandalf.

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:53.104
And Gandalf means...

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:54.856
...me.

00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:57.108
Gandalf?
Not Gandalf the wandering Wizard...

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.610
...who made such excellent...

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:03.573
...fireworks? Old Took used to have them
on Midsummer's Eve. Heh, heh. Ahem.
