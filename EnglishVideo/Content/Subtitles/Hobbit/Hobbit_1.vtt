00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.911
<i>And while I can honestly...</i>

00:01:20.912 --> 00:01:22.204
<i>...say I have told you...</i>

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:24.581
<i>...the truth...</i>

00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:29.582
<i>...I may not have told you all of it.</i>

00:01:34.884 --> 00:01:38.428
<i>I am old now, Frodo.</i>

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.429
<i>I'm not the same Hobbit I once was.</i>

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:46.186
<i>I think...</i>

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:49.189
<i>...it is time for you to know...</i>

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.360
<i>...what really happened.</i>

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:55.112
<i>It began...</i>

00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:57.906
<i>...long 890--</i>

00:01:57.907 --> 00:02:01.285
<i>...in a land far away to the east...</i>

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:06.286
<i>...the like of which you will not find
in the world today.</i>

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.969
<i>There was the city of Dale.</i>

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.304
<i>Its markets known...</i>

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:21.597
<i>...far and wide.</i>

00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:25.767
<i>Full of the bounties of vine and vale.</i>

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:30.768
<i>Peaceful and prosperous.</i>

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.442
<i>For this city lay before the doors...</i>

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:37.362
<i>...of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:</i>

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:39.740
<i>Erebor.</i>

00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.034
<i>Stronghold of Thror...</i>

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:45.037
<i>...King Under the Mountain. Mightiest...</i>

00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:47.998
<i>...of the Dwarf Lords.</i>

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.917
<i>Thror ruled with utter surety...</i>

00:02:50.918 --> 00:02:53.545
<i>...never doubting his house would endure...</i>

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:55.005
<i>...for his line lay secure...</i>

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.758
<i>...in the lives of his son...</i>

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.761
<i>...and grandson.</i>

00:03:00.762 --> 00:03:04.222
<i>Ah, Frodo. Erebor.</i>

00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:06.683
<i>Built deep within the mountain itself...</i>

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:10.520
<i>...the beauty of this fortress city was legend.</i>

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.273
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth...</i>

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:15.192
<i>...in precious gems hewn...</i>

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:18.528
<i>...from rock and in great seams of gold...</i>

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:23.529
<i>...running like rivers through stone.</i>

00:03:24.243 --> 00:03:26.078
<i>The skill of the Dwarves...</i>

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.081
<i>...was unequaled, fashioning objects...</i>

00:03:29.082 --> 00:03:31.917
<i>...of great beauty...</i>

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:36.213
<i>...out of diamond, emerald,
ruby and sapphire.</i>

00:03:36.214 --> 00:03:38.006
<i>Ever they delved deeper...</i>

00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:40.759
<i>...down into the dark.</i>

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.760
<i>And that is where they found it.</i>

00:03:49.644 --> 00:03:53.605
<i>The Heart of the Mountain.</i>

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:56.400
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>

00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:59.444
<i>Thror named it "The King's Jewel."</i>

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:02.614
<i>He took it as a sign,
a sign that his right to rule...</i>
