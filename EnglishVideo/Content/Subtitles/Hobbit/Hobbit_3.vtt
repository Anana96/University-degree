00:00:04.547 --> 00:00:07.132
Come on.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:12.133
<i>Erebor was lost.</i>

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:15.432
<i>For a dragon...</i>

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:18.018
<i>...will guard his plunder...</i>

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.019
<i>...as long as he lives.</i>

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:30.906
Run for your lives!

00:00:30.907 --> 00:00:35.907
Ah! Help us!

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.591
<i>Thranduil would not risk
the lives of his kin against...</i>

00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:51.760
<i>...the wrath of the dragon.</i>

00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:53.637
<i>No help came from the Elves...</i>

00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:58.638
<i>...that day, nor any day since.</i>

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.979
<i>Robbed of their homeland...</i>

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.524
<i>...the Dwarves of Erebor
wandered the wilderness...</i>

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:10.525
<i>...a once mighty people brought low.</i>

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:14.783
<i>The young Dwarf prince took work
where he could find it...</i>

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:17.286
<i>...laboring in the villages of Men.</i>

00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:19.997
<i>But always he remembered...</i>

00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:22.624
<i>...the mountain smoke beneath the moon...</i>

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.044
<i>...the trees like torches blazing bright.</i>

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:27.796
<i>For he had seen dragon fire...</i>

00:01:27.797 --> 00:01:29.548
...in the sky...

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.428
<i>...and a city turned to ash.</i>

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.430
<i>And he never forgave...</i>

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.016
<i>...and he never forgot.</i>

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:44.188
<i>Far away, in another corner of the world...</i>

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.105
<i>...dragons were...</i>

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:46.106
...only make-believe.

00:01:46.107 --> 00:01:47.149
Up they go!

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.150
<i>A party trick...</i>

00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:49.401
<i>...conjured by Wizards...</i>

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:51.069
<i>...on Midsummer's Eve.</i>

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.987
<i>No more frightening...</i>

00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:53.280
<i>...than fairy dust.</i>

00:01:55.742 --> 00:01:56.783
Bilbo!

00:01:56.784 --> 00:01:59.244
<i>And that, my dear Frodo...</i>

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:00.204
<i>...is where I come in.</i>

00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:03.707
Bilbo! Bilbo.

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:07.586
<i>It was the beginning
of an unlikely friendship...</i>

00:02:07.587 --> 00:02:10.464
<i>...that has lasted all my life.</i>

00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:18.180
<i>But it is not the start of my story.
For me, it began...</i>

00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:22.142
<i>Well, it began as you might expect.</i>

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:25.521
<i>In a hole in the ground, there lived...</i>

00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:28.774
<i>...a Hobbit.</i>

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:33.775
<i>Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole
full of worms and oozy smells.</i>

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:36.865
<i>This was a Hobbit hole.</i>

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:41.866
<i>And that means good food, a warm hearth...</i>

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.580
<i>...and all the comforts of home.</i>

00:03:19.784 --> 00:03:22.494
Thank you.

00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:24.121
What's this?

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:25.497
That is private.

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:28.500
Keep your sticky paws off.

00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:30.794
It's not ready yet.

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:32.504
Not ready for what?

00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:37.505
Reading.

00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:40.220
What on earth are these?

00:03:40.221 --> 00:03:42.264
Replies to the party invitations.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:46.810
Ah. Good gracious. Is it today?

00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:48.395
They all say they're coming.

00:03:48.396 --> 00:03:52.399
Except for the Sackville-Bagginses,
who are demanding you ask them in person.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.068
Are they, indeed? Over my...

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.112
-...dead body.
- They'd probably find that...

00:03:57.113 --> 00:03:58.196
...quite agreeable.

00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:00.574
They seem to think you have tunnels
overflowing with gold.

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:04.953
It was one small chest, hardly overflowing.
