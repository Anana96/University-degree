00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.795
<i>...was divine.</i>

00:00:02.796 --> 00:00:04.213
<i>All would pay...</i>

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:05.506
<i>...homage to him.</i>

00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:06.757
Even the great...

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:11.758
<i>...Elven King, Thranduil.</i>

00:00:14.683 --> 00:00:19.103
<i>As the great wealth of the Dwarves grew...</i>

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:24.104
<i>...their store of good will ran thin.</i>

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:29.401
<i>No one knows exactly what began the rift.</i>

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:31.115
<i>The Elves say...</i>

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:33.701
<i>...the Dwarves stole their treasure.</i>

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.453
<i>The Dwarves tell another tale.</i>

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:40.124
<i>They say the Elf King
refused to give them their rightful pay.</i>

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:42.585
<i>It is sad, Frodo, how old alliances...</i>

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:43.919
<i>...can be broken.</i>

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.339
<i>How friendships between peoples
can be lost.</i>

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.176
And for what?

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:02.021
<i>Slowly the days turned sour...</i>

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:07.022
<i>...and the watchful nights closed in.</i>

00:01:13.617 --> 00:01:16.160
<i>Thror's love of gold...</i>

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:19.747
<i>...had grown too fierce.</i>

00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:24.543
<i>A sickness had begun to grow within him.</i>

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:29.544
<i>It was a sickness of the mind.</i>

00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:33.469
<i>And where sickness thrives...</i>

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.470
<i>...bad things will follow.</i>

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:47.358
<i>The first they heard
was a noise...</i>

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.235
<i>...like a hurricane coming down...</i>

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:50.444
<i>...from the North.</i>

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:53.239
<i>The pines on the mountain
creaked and cracked...</i>

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.825
<i>...in the hot, dry wind.</i>

00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:03.207
Balin, sound the alarm.

00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:07.128
Call out the guard. Do it now!

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:08.587
What is it?

00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:10.756
Dragon.

00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:15.094
Dragon!

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.053
<i>He was...</i>

00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:21.054
<i>...a firedrake from the North.</i>

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.231
<i>Smaug...</i>

00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:32.232
<i>...had come.</i>

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:03.058
<i>Such wanton death...</i>

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.520
<i>...was dealt that day.</i>

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.230
<i>For this city of Men was nothing...</i>

00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.232
<i>...to Smaug.</i>

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:11.275
<i>His eye...</i>

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:16.276
<i>...was set on another prize.</i>

00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:20.034
<i>For dragons...</i>

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:21.952
<i>...covet gold...</i>

00:03:21.953 --> 00:03:23.037
<i>...with a dark and...</i>

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:28.038
<i>...fierce desire.</i>

00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:57.404
Aah!

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:02.405
No!
