00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.653
<i>/ feel it in the earth.</i>

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:18.240
<i>/ smell it in the air.</i>

00:00:18.616 --> 00:00:20.534
<i>Much that once was...</i>

00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:22.286
<i>...is lost.</i>

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:26.040
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:43.307
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.</i>

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.434
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:49.397
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.</i>

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:52.525
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:57.697
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.</i>

00:00:58.155 --> 00:00:59.407
<i>And nine...</i>

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:02.618
<i>...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...</i>

00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:06.664
<i>...who, above all else, desire power.</i>

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.003
<i>For within these rings was bound the
strength and will to govern each race.</i>

00:01:14.505 --> 00:01:17.675
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:20.010
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:24.432
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...</i>

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:29.311
<i>...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...</i>

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.564
<i>...to control all others.</i>

00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:35.735
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...</i>

00:01:35.943 --> 00:01:40.156
<i>...and his will to dominate all life.</i>

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:44.994
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

00:01:45.828 --> 00:01:47.496
<i>One by one...</i>

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:52.376
<i>...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:55.629
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

00:01:56.088 --> 00:02:00.760
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:05.598
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for Middle-earth's freedom.</i>

[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.547
<i>Victory was near.</i>

00:02:43.302 --> 00:02:45.054
<i>But the power of the Ring...</i>

00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:47.306
<i>...could not be undone.</i>

00:03:11.914 --> 00:03:13.833
<i>It was in this moment...</i>

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:16.418
<i>...when all hope had faded...</i>

00:03:16.627 --> 00:03:20.756
<i>...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.</i>

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:58.335
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:07.386
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...</i>

00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:11.807
<i>...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:14.643
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:17.354
<i>...are easily corrupted.</i>

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:22.234
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.747
<i>It betrayed Isildur to his death.</i>

00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:40.794
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...</i>

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:43.339
<i>...were lost.</i>

00:04:44.173 --> 00:04:46.383
<i>History became legend...</i>

00:04:46.592 --> 00:04:48.594
<i>...legend became myth.</i>

00:04:48.802 --> 00:04:51.680
<i>And for 2500 years...</i>

00:04:51.847 --> 00:04:55.559
<i>...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.</i>

00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:59.021
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

00:04:59.688 --> 00:05:02.816
<i>...it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

My precious.

00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:11.825
FEMALE VOICE:
<i>The Ring came to the creature Gollum...</i>

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:15.913
<i>...who took it deep
into the Misty Mountains.</i>

00:05:16.205 --> 00:05:19.083
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.335
GOLLUM:
It came to me.

00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:25.965
My own. My love. My own.

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:30.886
My precious.

FEMALE VOICE: <i>The Ring
brought to Gollum unnatural long life.</i>

<i>And in the gloom of Gollurn's cave,
it waited.</i>

00:05:46.985 --> 00:05:50.239
<i>Darkness crept back into
the forests of the world.</i>

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:53.325
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:56.328
<i>...whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

00:05:56.537 --> 00:05:59.832
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.835
<i>...its time had now come.</i>

00:06:05.254 --> 00:06:07.923
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.095
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:18.517
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

Lost!
